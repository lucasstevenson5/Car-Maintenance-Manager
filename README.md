# Car Maintenance Buddy
1. Title: Car Maintenance Buddy

2. Description:
    1. This project is designed to be an aid for those who try to keep track of work they do on their car, have a shop do on their car, and anywhere in between. This can be as simple as keep track of your oil changes to being a one stop shop of maintenance logs (personal work and shop work) and part changes. The main idea here is to try to make life easier when doing regular maintenance on your car and also to be cognizant of parts a shop may have changed for you and actually realizing if the same parts go bad early. Alot of cars nowadays have trackers for oil and even tires and brakes, but this app can be for those who'd like a way to track it themselves especially as they are performing the maintenance themselves. This stems mainly from doing regular maintenance on my car and my family's cars with my dad and seeing how everything he does is tracked with a small notebook.

3. User Stories: 
    1. As an unregistered user, I want to be able to sign up with a username and password so that I can start tracking my car's maintenance history.
    1. As a registered user, I want to be directed straight to my profile and be allowed to update my personal info at any time in case I spelled something incorrectly.
    1. As a registered user, I want to make sure my profile is private and people cant navigate to it if they know my unique URL.
    1. As a registered user, I want to be able to add every car in my garage so I can stop getting confused on when the last time oil was changed in each car.
    1. As a car owner, I want to be able to add maintenance items for my car and the mileage they happened at so I know when they need to be done next.
    1. As a car owner, I want to be able to see suggested maintenance intervals based on standard cars.
    1. As a car owner, I would like the ability to update maintenance intervals based on what I find in my owner's manual or if I use non-dealer products such as synthetic oil that is rated to higher mileage.
    1. As a car owner, I would like the ability to track which parts were changed when i bring the car into the shop for repairs.
    1. Additionally as a car owner, I would like to be able to upload receipts and documentation on what was replaced and when to keep that information backed up in case I lose the receipt.

5. List of Features - Post MVP
    1. Allow users to either export maintenance history or parts log as a pdf and send email it to themselves
    1. Turn the typical maintenance intervals into something smarter that uses an api (maybe EdmundsAPI) to tailor the suggestions to your specific year, make, model
    1. Whether or not the second works, would be interesting to add a list of tips that cycles on the homepage letting you know that if you changed your oil at 20k in April that your next oil change would normally be due at 23k miles or in July.
    1. Super stretch goal would be to implement this as more than just a personal app and allow users to post a car "for sale" on the homepage and unregistered users can view the history of what was replaced on the car. Could give car buyers some comfort knowing how well their car was maintained.
